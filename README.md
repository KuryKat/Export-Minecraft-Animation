EMA simplifies the creation of animated textures for Minecraft, making it easier for you to bring your pixel art animations to life in the game.

## Usage

This repository contains two versions of EMA, a script for easy exportation of animated textures, which was the feature from the original project, and a powerful Extension with some features to make your animating process easier, such as setting the frame rate to match the Minecraft frametime, which uses the Ticks Per Frame logic, which differs from the default FPS logic that aseprite has.

You can use either one, but please prefix issues with "Script" or "Extension" when reporting bugs!
